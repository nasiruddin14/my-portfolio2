            <h2>How to handwash? With soap and water</h2>
    
            <p>Hand hygiene, either with soap and water or with alcohol-based handrub, is one of the best ways to avoid getting sick and spreading infections to others. Indeed, hand hygiene is an easy, inexpensive, and effective mean to prevent the spread of germs and keep everyone  healthy.
                When should you clean your hands?
         
        -          BEFORE, DURING and AFTER preparing food.
        -          BEFORE eating food.
        -          BEFORE and AFTER caring for a sick person.
        -          AFTER using the toilet.
        -          AFTER changing the diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.
        -          AFTER blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
        -          AFTER touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
        -          AFTER touching garbage.

            <h2>All about masks in the context of COVID-19</h2>
            <p>Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.
                If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!
                Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible.
                Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:
                    Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
                    Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. 
                    When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
                    Don’t use masks with valves.</p>

            <h2>Vaccine doses</h2>
            <p>For some COVID-19 vaccines, two doses are required. It’s important to get the second dose if the vaccine requires two doses.

                For vaccines that require two doses, the first dose presents antigens – proteins that stimulate the production of antibodies – to the immune system for the first time. Scientists call this priming the immune response. The second dose acts as a booster, ensuring the immune system develops a memory response to fight off the virus if it encounters it again.
                
                Because of the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, initial clinical trials of vaccine candidates were performed with the shortest possible duration between doses. Therefore an interval of 21–28 days (3–4 weeks) between doses is recommended by WHO. Depending on the vaccine, the interval may be extended for up to 42 days – or even up to 12 weeks for some vaccines – on the basis of current evidence.
                
                There are many COVID-19 vaccines being developed and produced by different manufacturers around the world. WHO recommends that a vaccine from the same manufacturer be used for both doses if you require two doses. This recommendation may be updated as further information becomes available.</p>
